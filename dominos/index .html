                With Domino's it is always “Rishton ka time”. Whether it's a treat for your promotion, a kid topping his class or winning the 
                heart of your wife who is too tired to cook after a long day at work! A cheesy slice of the best pizza is all one needs to put things 
                into perspective and start any celebration. Plus, you do not even need to rush to the restaurant to have one now. A call, a few clicks 
                on our website or a few touches on the mobile screen is all you have to do to have that tempting, light-on-the-pocket pizza at your doorstep. <br><br>

                There is something for everyone here. The vegetarians, non-vegetarians, the sides’ lovers and also the ones who love to have something sweet by the time they reach the last bite of the last slice of pizza slice.

                No matter what the situation, pizza always helps. Especially a pizza that gives you the freedom to choose your
                toppings - from paneer, crisp capsicum, onion, grilled mushroom, golden corn, black olives, fresh tomato, red 
                paprika, jalapeno, paneer tikka and extra cheese to non-veg toppings such as pepper barbeque chicken, peri-peri
                chicken, grilled chicken rasher, chicken sausage or chicken tikka- the options are almost endless, anything and
                everything you can think of that too on top of the crust of your choice - New hand-tossed crust, wheat thin crust
                , cheese burst crust, classic hand-tossed crust or a fresh pan pizza. Because just like a pizza, Domino's understands you. <br><br>

                And to shoo away those end-of-the-month blues while placing your order with our pizza restaurant, check out the everyday pizzas from pizza mania combos with everyday value offer of 2 pizzas starting at just ₹99 (regular size) and ₹199 (medium size) each.
